All modifications and additions should be applied to the files in the path `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User`.

Place the "Package Control.sublime-settings" in the path mentioned above first then open sublime text and install the package control. All packages should then be installed automatically and you can proceed with copying all the settings to the same place.

IMPORTANT!! Do not copy the setting files over before you have first copied "Package Control.sublime-settings" and opened sublime text to install all packages.
